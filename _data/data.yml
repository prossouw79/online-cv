    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I have been on a journey of ignorance-busting and both academics and industry experience have proven excellent paths to take. I'm currently active in the financial services sector with exposure to agricultural, banking and regulatory companies within the sector. I'm a tinkerer at heart and well-suited to proof-of-concept work that applies fresh innovation to novel problems. I care about data privacy and security and have learnt the skills to be confident in handling client sensitive data. I'm currently challenging myself in product development to learn the grit and diligence that these long-term, multi-client engagements require.
